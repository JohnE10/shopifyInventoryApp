For example, the AT-130 will match a 7 m (23 feet) long wire antenna across the marine band in the 1.6 - 27.5 MHz range.<br><br><b>Automatic tuning</b><br>No manual tuning is needed. Just push the [TUNE] switch on an Icom HF marine transceiver; the AT-130 adjusts the antenna and the transceiver to the minimum SWR in any frequency on an HF marine band. The AT-130 allows you to transmit with strong RF output power, and is perfect for maritime mobile operations.<br><br><b>Weather resistant</b><br>The AT-130 is housed in a durable, completely weather-resistant acrylic case with rubber gaskets. This allows it to be conveniently installed near the antenna element base.<br><br><b>For Icom HF marine transceivers</b><br>Icom's sophisticated AT-130 easily matches Icom HF marine transceivers. The AT-130 easily interconnects with an Icom HF marine transceiver. AT-130 installation is simple. No adjustments are necessary. Just connect the control cable and antenna wire and go!<br><br><b>Quick tune-up</b><br>Improved tuning performance...the tune-up time is less than 3 seconds in any frequency on an HF marine band. In addition, the AT-130 has 8 convenient memories to store tuning information. Retuning for a memorized frequency takes about 1.5 seconds. This allows you quick trouble-free frequency changes.<br><br><b>Low power tune-up</b><br>The AT-130 emits very little output power (just 300 mW) during the tuning process. This reduces the possibility of causing interference to other stations using the frequency.<br><br><b>Specifications</b><br><ul><li>Dimensions: 230(W) x 340(H) x 80(D) mm; 9.1(W) x 13.4(H) x 3.1(D) in (projections not included)<br>    <li>Weight: 2.7 kg; 6.0 lb<br>    <li>Usable Temperature Range: -30C ~ +60C<br>    <li>Rated Voltage: 13.6 V DC +/-15% (negative ground) (supplied from an Icom HF marine transceiver)<br>    <li>Current Drain (at 13.6 V DC): 2 A<br>    <li>Frequency Coverage: 1.6~30 MHz (with the antenna length 7 m (23 ft) or longer)<br>    <li>Input Impedance: 50 ohms (unbalanced)<br>    <li>Max.
